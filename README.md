# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data.  

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Train-test split with stratification  
- Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
- Visualization of results  

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📈 Model Performance  
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 81% | 84% | 82% | 83% |
